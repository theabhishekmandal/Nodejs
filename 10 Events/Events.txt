Event : Something that has happened in our app that we can respond to.

In node we have two kinds of events.
    1 - System Events that comes from c++ core (libuv library file) 
        Eg: such as receiving a file, recieving data from internet, opening a file
    
    2 - Custom Events that comes from Javascript core (Event Emitter Javascript file)

    libuv sends the lower level System events to event emitter.
    When there is any event occurs, libuv sends this to custom events so that we can manage it properly

    Javascript itself does not have any Eventing concept. But, we can create our own event library
    with the technique that the node event emitter uses
