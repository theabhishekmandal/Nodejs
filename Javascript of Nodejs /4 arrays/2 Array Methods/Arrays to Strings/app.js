// two methods to convert array to Strings

// first method is toString() which converts arrays to String by seperating them using commas
var fruits= ["apple", "banana", "orange", "mango"];
console.log(fruits.toString());

// second method is by using the join() method, here you can use your own seperator
console.log(fruits.join("/"));
